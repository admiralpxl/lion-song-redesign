# The Lion Song - landign page Redesign.

This repository has my project of the redesign for the landing page of the game The Lion Song for Mi'pu'mi Games.
I  decide to make this project to practices my habilities design a landing page from the Figma sketch to the HTML and CSS code, also added some Vanilla Javascript to apply animation on the scroll effect and the sidebar menu.
I practice my knowledge about CSS Animation, Transition, and Transformation, the page was made with mobile-first methodology and has a fully responsive design to tablet and desktop.
